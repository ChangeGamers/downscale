Better image downscale with canvas
===================================
This function downscales images in the browser, producing a better quality result, than the traditional [`CanvasRenderingContext2D.scale()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/scale "The CanvasRenderingContext2D.scale() method of the Canvas 2D API adds a scaling transformation to the canvas units by x horizontally and by y vertically.") method. It neutralises the "fuzzy" look caused by the native canvas downsampling, when processing relatively large images such as photos taken by smartphone.

```javascript
downscale(sourceImg, 170, 170).
then(function(dataURL) {
  var previewImg = document.createElement('img')
  previewImg.src = dataURL
  document.body.appendChild(previewImg)
})
```

Motivation
----------
While other image resizing libraries are based on complex interpolation algorithms such as [Lanczos resampling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lanczos_resampling "Lanczos resampling and Lanczos filtering are two applications of a mathematical formula. It can be used as a low-pass filter or used to smoothly interpolate the value of a digital signal between its samples."), image downscaling usually doesn't require that complexity, because there is no interpolation happening (in other words we don't create new pixels).

On the other hand, browsers implement very fast [`HTMLCanvasElement`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLCanvasElement "The HTMLCanvasElement interface provides properties and methods for manipulating the layout and presentation of canvas elements.") downsampling, when the pixel from source position is directly transfered to the destination position, loosing all the neighbouring pixels information. The resulting image may often look very noisy.

To resolve this problem, the proposed method implements a simple [linear downsampling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimation_(signal_processing) "In digital signal processing, decimation is the process of reducing the sampling rate of a signal.") algorithm, that produces preferable results with relatively small processing time.

Syntax
------
```javascript
Promise<DOMString> downscale(source, width, height[, options]);
```

### Return value
A [`Promise`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Promise "The Promise interface represents a proxy for a value not necessarily known at its creation time. It allows you to associate handlers to an asynchronous action's eventual success or failure. This lets asynchronous methods return values like synchronous methods: instead of the final value, the asynchronous method returns a promise of having a value at some point in the future.") that resolves to a [`DOMString`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DOMString "DOMString is a UTF-16 String. As JavaScript already uses such strings, DOMString is mapped directly to a String.") containing the resulting image in [data URI](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/data_URIs "URLs prefixed with the data: scheme, allow content creators to embed small files inline in documents.") format.
